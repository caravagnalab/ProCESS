rRACES implements a first order unquantified logic having variables
representing the cardinality of the species, the number of events
fired in a species (being duplications, deaths, or switches), and
the simulation time. These variables and reals values are summed by
`+`, subtracted by `-`, and multiplied by `*` and form expressions.
The expressions are then compared with the standard semantics by
`>`, `>=`, `==`, `!=`, `<=`, and `<` to form relations.
A formula in this language is either a relation, the conjunction
of two formulas (`&`), or the disjunction of two formulas (`|`).

Any formula in above language expresses a condition on the simulation
status and it can be used as the parameter of the method
`SpatialSimulation$run_until()` to let the simulation evolve until
the condition does not hold.

### Variables

The variables represent one among the following quantities:

-  the cardinality of a species;
-  the number fired event among deaths, duplications and switches in a species;
-  the elapse simulation time.

All above variables can be built by using the method `SpatialSimulation$var()`.
When the parameter is the string `"Time"`, the elapsed simulation time
variable is returned.

```{r}
library(rRACES)

# set the seed of the random number generator
set.seed(0)

# build a spatial simulation and add two species to it
sim <- SpatialSimulation()
sim$add_mutant(name = "A",
               epigenetic_rates = c("+-" = 0.01, "-+" = 0.01),
               growth_rates = c("+" = 0.2, "-" = 0.08),
               death_rates = c("+" = 0.1, "-" = 0.01))

# get the variable representing the simulation time
v_time <- sim$var("Time")

v_time
```

When the parameter is the name of a species,
a variable representing the cardinality of the species is built.

```{r}
# get the variable representing the cardinality of A+ in sim
va_p <- sim$var("A+")
va_p

# get the variable representing the cardinality of A- in sim
va_m <- sim$var("A-")
va_m
```


Finally, when the parameter is the name of a species followed by
a `.` and the name of an event among `deaths`, `duplications`,
or `switches`, `SpatialSimulation$var()` returns
the variable associated with the number of
the corresponding event in the specified species.

```{r}
# get the variable representing the number of epigenetic
# switches from A+
va_ps <- sim$var("A+.switches")
va_ps

# get the variable representing the number of duplications in A+
sim$var("A+.duplications")

# get the variable representing the number of deaths in A+
sim$var("A+.deaths")
```

### Expressions and Formulas

An expression is one of the following object:

-  a variable, e.g., `sim$var("A+")`;
-  a numeric value, e.g., `3.4`;
-  the sum of two expressions, e.g., `sim$var("A+") + 3.4`;
-  the subtraction of two expressions, e.g., `sim$var("A+") - 3.4`;
-  the multiplication of two expressions, e.g., `sim$var("A+") * 3.4`.

Two expression can be related by `<=`, `<`, `==`, `!=`, `>` and
`>=`.

A formula is:

-  a relation among two expressions, e.g., `sim$var("A+")>=2`;
-  the conjunction of two formulas, e.g., `sim$var("A+")>=2 & sim$var("A+")<=500`;
-  the disjunction of two formulas, e.g., `sim$var("A+")>=2 | sim$var("A+")<=500`.

### The method `SpatialSimulation$run_until()`

The method `SpatialSimulation$run_until()` takes as the parameter a formula and
lets the simulation evolve until
the formula does not hold.

```{r}
# build a condition stating that the cardinality of A+ doubles
# that of A-
c1 <- va_p >= 2 * va_m
c1

# build a condition that holds when there are more than
# 100000 live cells of mutant A
c2 <- va_p + va_m > 1e5
c2

# build a condition that holds when less than 4000
# epigenetic switches from the species A+ have occured
c3 <- va_ps < 4000
c3

# build a condition that holds when 40 time unit have been
# simulated at least
c4 <- v_time >= 40
c4

# build a condition that holds when c4 and at least one
# among c1, c2, and c3 hold
c5 <- c4 & (c1 | c2 | c3)
c5

# place the initial cell
sim$place_cell("A+", 500, 500)

# run the simulation while c5 does not hold
sim$run_until(c5)

sim
sim$get_clock()
```
