rRACES implements two ways to interface to the C++ [RACES](https://github.com/albertocasagrande/RACES) simulation and data-generation engine:

- leveraging S4 classes provided by the [R/C++ Rcpp interface](https://www.rcpp.org/);
- leveraging an S3 class that wraps calls to the Rcpp interface;

Both can be used to:

- simulate a spatio-temporal stochastic process of tumour evolution;
- define a tumour sampling strategy;
- generating realistic sequencing data based on sampling and simulation.
