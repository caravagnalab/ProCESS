rRACES wraps the [RACES](https://github.com/albertocasagrande/RACES) simulation and data-generation engine by using the 
[R/C++ Rcpp interface](https://www.rcpp.org/)

It can:

- simulate a spatio-temporal stochastic process of tumour evolution;
- define a tumour sampling strategy;
- generating realistic sequencing data based on sampling and simulation.

In the articles section of this website we present all the functionalities of this tool.
