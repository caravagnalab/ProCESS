The mutation engine places mutation on the sampled cell genome according to the
[infinite sites model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinite_sites_model) by default.
In particular, any new mutations is placed on a locus whose context is mutation-free.

Let us consider the phylogenetic forest as build in `vignette("mutations")` and verify
whether it satisfies the infinite site model.

# test whether the infinite sites conditions hold in the built forest
test_infinite_sites_model(phylo_forest)
```

This behavior can be changed by using the mutation engine property
`MutationEngine$infinite_sites_model()`. This property is a Boolean flag
that enable/disable the infinite sites model.

```{r}
# establish whether the infinite sites model is used
m_engine$infinite_sites_model

# disable it
m_engine$infinite_sites_model <- FALSE
```

When the infinite sites model is disabled,
`MutationEngine$place_mutations()` may place two mutations
in the same locus of different alleles of the same genome
or the same mutation in the same locus of one allele
of the genomes of two cells that are not each other ancestors.

```{r}
# test whether the infinite sites model is enable
m_engine$infinite_sites_model

# place the mutations on the same samples forest used above
phylo_forest2 <- m_engine$place_mutations(samples_forest, 1000, 500)

# test whether the infinite sites conditions hold in the new forest
test_infinite_sites_model(phylo_forest2)
```
